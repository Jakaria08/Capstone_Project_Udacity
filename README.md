# Capstone_Project_Udacity

This project is the final project for Udacity AWS Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree. This project is about predicting
six types of human action such as standing, walking, laying etc. from mobile phone sensor data. I used three models: Support Vector
Machine, Neural Network and Logistic Regression for modeling the problem and comparison of outputs. I used cross validation and significance test
to get the best model. <p/>
The train and test dataset are given in .csv format and located in 
Capstone_Project_Udacity/data/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones. 
All the codes are written in the capstone_project.ipynb notebook and located in Capstone_Project_Udacity/code/.
